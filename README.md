# Arch32iso
Files to make a lightweight ArchLinux32 ISO for i686 systems with under 256MB of ram with some QOL tools.
I've tested it down to 192MB of ram but it should be able to work in just 64MB of ram, albeit at very slow speeds.
## How to run it?
just run `makeiso.sh` and boom! it does everything for you!
Intened to run under Arch Linux (64-bit) or Arch Linux (32-bit)
