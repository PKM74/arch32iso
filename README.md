# Arch32iso
Files to make a lightweight Arch Linux 32 ISO for i686 systems with under 256MB of ram with some QOL tools.
I've tested it down to 192MB of ram but it *should* be able to run down to 164MB? the FS is like 135MB. so no, it cant even run in 128MB... (i tried... it just dies) 
## How to run it?
just run `makeiso.sh` and boom! it does everything for you!
Intened to run under Arch Linux or Arch Linux 32
